Top your hot chocolate, make s\'mores, or just enjoy them one by one for a sweet snack.',275,12,188,'<h4>Combine the powder sugar and cornstarch:</h4><p>In a large bowl, using a whisk, gently combine powdered sugar and cornstarch.</p><h4>Prep the pan:</h4><p>Grease an 8x8-inch square baking pan with a small amount of oil and then lightly sift about half the powdered sugar and cornstarch mix all over the bottom and sides of the pan. Set aside. Reserve the remaining powdered sugar-cornstarch mix for dusting the cut marshmallows later on.</p><h4>Whip the aquafaba:</h4><p>Pour the aquafaba into the bowl of a stand mixer (or deep mixing bowl if using a hand mixer) fitted with the whisk attachment. Begin to whip the aquafaba on low until it looks foamy or frothy, about 20 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>Then increase the speed to medium-high until stiff peaks are achieved, 10 to 12 minutes (it might take longer depending on temperature, age of aquafaba, and other factors in the kitchen). Once stiff peaks are reached (which means that your whipped aquafaba should stand straight up off the beater without flopping over), turn off the mixer.</p><h3><strong>SIMPLE TIP!</strong></h3><p>Unlike egg whites, there’s no danger in overwhipping aquafaba, so don’t worry about leaving the mixer running too long.</p><h4>Cook the syrup:&nbsp;</h4><p>First measure out ingredients for syrup. In a medium saucepan add the granulated sugar, corn syrup, and 1/4 cup of the water. Whisk together until it looks like wet sand.</p><p>Using a pastry brush dipped in water, gently sweep any sugar crystals back into the pan (this will help keep the syrup from crystalizing). Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan, careful not to touch the bottom, and place over medium-high heat. Let the mixture come to a boil without stirring. You’ll want the syrup mixture to reach 285°F (soft crack), which may take around 10 minutes (this time can vary a lot—keep a close eye on the thermometer).&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as the syrup reaches 285°F, lower your heat as low as it will go and let the mixture sit on low until ready to use.<br>&nbsp;</p><h4>Cook the agar-agar mixture:</h4><p>In a small saucepan, mix the agar-agar and the remaining 3/4 cup water. Turn the heat on medium-low until the mixture begins to simmer, whisking constantly. Cook until small bubbles form around the edges (watch the heat; if the agar-agar starts to boil, it will congeal).&nbsp;</p><p>Let it simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, until the mixture thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon. Remove it from the heat, whisking a final time.</p><h4>Add the agar-agar into the whipped aquafaba:</h4><p>Remove the bowl from the mixer. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the agar agar mixture into the whipped aquafaba until just combined, (a few small lumps are okay). You\'re doing this by hand so the agar mixture does not splash way up on the sides of the bowl the way it would if the mixer were running.<br>&nbsp;</p><h4>Add the hot syrup into the aquafaba and agar-agar mixture:</h4><p>Return the bowl and the whip attachment to the mixer. With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour the hot syrup (watch your hands!) into the bowl.&nbsp;</p><p>You may have to turn it on and off a few times if it expands too much. Once all the syrup is in the bowl, turn the mixer on high. It’s normal for the mixture to deflate at this point.&nbsp;</p><p>Mix on high until the bottom of the bowl is no longer hot to the touch and the mixture is glossy, about 10 minutes. Towards the end of the 10 minute mark, pour in the vanilla extract and continue to whip.<br>&nbsp;</p><h4>Allow the marshmallows to sit:</h4><p>Allow the marshmallows to sit, uncovered, for 4 to 6 hours, depending on how thick your mixture is, and how dry the environment is. You can test for doneness by nudging the area between the pan and the marshmallow with a spatula or butter knife. If it moves without sticking to the pan, it’s dry.</p><h4>Cut the marshmallows:</h4><p>Sprinkle the top of the marshmallows with the reserved powdered sugar and cornstarch mix (if yours has clumped together, gently stir with a whisk to re-mix). Sift more of the powdered sugar-cornstarch mixture onto a cutting board, then turn the marshmallow from the pan onto the board. Cut to the desired size with a sharp knife, then toss the marshmallows in a bowl with more of the powdered sugar mix.</p><h4>Serve and store:</h4><p>Transfer to an airtight container and keep at room temperature up to 1 week.&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoyed the marshmallows as a sweet snack, use to top your hot chocolate, or make s\'mores.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','63c5ae9af282a.jpg','2023-01-15',6),(3,'Tofu Scramble Burrito Bowl','Vegan Tofu Scramble Burrito Bowl is the perfect plant-based meal for lovers of all things tofu.
